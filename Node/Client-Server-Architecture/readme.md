### Some Convention which exist out there for setting up API

1. REST - Most Relevant
2. GRPC
3. SOAP

4. **REST**

   - REST stands for Representation State Transfer
   - Every real life entity is expected to be represented as a `Resource`. ---> Eg - Movie in BookMyShow is the resource.
     Rest heavily rely on the term `resource` that is real life entity. Everything that we do in `REST` is going to be wrt Real life entity.
   - Everytime with a RESTFUL API request has to send `type/methods` of the Request.

     - GET
     - POST
     - PUT
     - PATCH
     - DELETE
